## About Me

<font size="-1">

🎨 I love to code and solve puzzles as much as building good looking and intuitive interfaces. If it's code related please count me in!

💻 Proficient in a variety of frontend technologies including **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **ReactJS**; always eager to explore new tools and techniques.

## What I Do

<font size="-1">

🔭 Currently, I'm sculpting my portfolio, shaping it (or at least trying to) into something that's not the average SPA.

🖌️ Diving deeper into **UI/UX design** and **Docker**.

💬 Let's collaborate! Whether it's optimizing performance, refining UX/UI, or brainstorming innovative ideas, I'm all ears!

## Fun Facts

<font size="-1">

🌻 When I'm not perfecting pixels, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing the latest indie games, or reading a good book.

🌟 **My mantra:** "Try it, if it fails it will be a good story to tell".
