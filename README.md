## What I Do

<font size="-1">

🔭 Currently, I'm sculpting my portfolio, shaping it (or at least trying to) into something that's not the average SPA.

🖌️ I’m currently diving deeper into **UI/UX design** and **Docker** to elevate my skills and stay ahead of the curve.

💬 Let's collaborate! Whether it's optimizing performance, refining UX/UI, or brainstorming innovative ideas, I'm all ears!

## Fun Facts

<font size="-1">

🌻 When I'm not perfecting pixels, you can find me **exploring the great outdoors**, playing the latest indie games, or delving into a good book.

🌟 **My mantra:** "Try it, if it fails it will be a good story to tell"
